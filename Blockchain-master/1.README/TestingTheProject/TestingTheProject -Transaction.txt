1.In cmd type
  -- npm run dev
  This will start the the blockchain


2.In another cmp
   --set HTTP_PORT=3002 && set P2P_PORT=5002 && set PEERS=ws://localhost:3001 && npm run dev
   This will start another socket and connect it to Server.

3.Open PostMan

4.Create a get Request and type
   -->localhost:3002/public-key
 
 This will result you the public key of User2 who is at port 3001
 Copy the long publicKey Address

5. Create a post Request and type
   --> localhost:3001/transact
   -->Go to body Tab and select RAW and application JSON

  type in the blank Area
  
  {
   "recipient" : "paste the public Key" ,
   "amount" : 50
   }

  Then press SEND 2-3 times.

   We will find the amount gets substracted from the sender's wallet
   and there will be output objects which shows the outgoing transaction .

6.Create a GET Request and type
   -->localhost:3001/transactions

  --> this will show the transaction pool of 3001

7.Create a GET request and type
 -->localhost:3002/transactions
 -->This will give the same as above because, 3001 is sending amount to 3002 ,So it will be reflected in both transaction pools untill it get mined by some miner



8.Create A GET request and type
  ---> localhost:3001/mine-transactions
 
This will show the Blockchain whose second object is transaction list and the reward Transaction for the miner who did the act of mining.
 

9.Create a POST request and type
  --> localhost:/3001/transact

Now the unconfirmed transactions get removed from transaction pool and the Balance get updated.
